# This is a open web project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Abstract
**Note: this is a test version. You canâ€™t run this**

When we decorate our rooms or desks we can only see the size and image of online items but the size and shape of the rooms are different so we had to check and purchase each of them. To solve this inconvenience we have designed a service that informs the purchase link so that users can simply place the product components in a flat map implemented by HTML and CSS and even purchase them. To keep up with the latest IT trends, we will create web apps that can be used anywhere, anytime.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


## konva.js

We use [konva.js](https://konvajs.org/docs/react/Intro.html) for drawing items.
